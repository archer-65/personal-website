## Who am I?

My name is Mario, and I'm a computer science student at [Federico II](https://www.unina.it/home). I love working with UNIX-like systems and administering them, and I have recently approached the concept of Infrastructure as Code, specifically with Nix and NixOS, which I use as daily-driver.

### My skills

As a student and enthusiast, I spend as much time as possible to improve my knowledge. During the last two years of my university course, I have gained a lot of experience in the administration of GNU/Linux systems, Android development, Clean Architecture and Clean Code.

Without considering scripting languages as **Bash**, or markup languages, I am competent in **Java**, **Kotlin** and **C** as programming languages, but I also know a little bit of **Elisp**, **JavaScript**, **Golang** and **Python**.

### What do I want?

As I said, I've recently approached **IaC**, an important part of **DevOps** practices and **CI/CD**, this is not a coincidence. DevOps Engineer? Solutions Architect? I don't know, the job title is not really important as long as I can work on what I like, we'll see :smile:.
